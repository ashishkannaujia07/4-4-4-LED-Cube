Components Required

LEDs: 64 (16 for each layer)
Resistors: 220Ω (for each LED)
Arduino Board: Any Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Transistors: 4 NPN transistors (for controlling layers)
Jumper Wires: For connections
Breadboard: For prototyping
Power Supply: If needed (for a larger number of LEDs)

Here’s a basic outline of how to connect your components:

Layer and Column Connections

Each layer of the cube has 16 LEDs arranged in a 4x4 grid.
Each LED's anode (long leg) connects to the column pins (C1 to C4).
Each LED's cathode (short leg) connects to the layer pins (L1 to L4) via transistors.

Here’s a simplified version of the connections:

Layers (L1 to L4): Connected to the collectors of the transistors.
Columns (C1 to C4): Connected to the anodes of the LEDs.

Arduino Pin Connections

Layer Pins (L1 to L4): Use pins 8, 9, 10, and 11.
Column Pins (C1 to C4): Use pins 2, 3, 4, and 5
